<h1>Web Tech: Client-Side Report</h1>
<h3>Name: Anu Anandarajah</h3>
<h3>Candidate: 63721</h3>
<p>The following Report will outline the processes undertaken in creating my website and detail features 
which may otherwise be missed. Before I begin, I do apologise for not having paired up but I knew of only 
two others who'd taken this unit from my course and I was not entirely keen on finding a computer science 
student and burdening them with my lack of programming experience. The website I have attempted to create 
is for The Engineering Societies (TUBES) Rugby Team, which is currently aiming to expand its online and 
social media presence.</p>
<p>I originally began without any frameworks, but quickly realised that I was wasting time re-writing
code that others had already. I started using the skeleton framework due to its simplicity but ultimately ended up using Bootstrap
in the final project. This change was originally due to wanting moving slides on my title page but I stuck
with it due its popularity and huge list of resources and tutorials available online. Its responsive display
also meant I could build the site to a size of my liking and have it re-size and re-align the elements 
automatically.</p>
<p>The bulk of my time was spent on the Home Page. The main feature here is the slideshow which took far longer
than I'd like to admit to work entirely and (hopefully) on all the major browsers. I did this using the carousel
function from 'Bootstrap', with modifications as desired. The main came difficulty with positioning and resizing, 
and in my code you will find a mixture of absolute and relative positioning as well as the use of z-index and a 
variety of padding and margins etc. I can assume it was probably not the cleanest or most efficient way to have 
done it, but it works. The button styling used in this was found online in its entirety, however I modified the colours 
and sizing to fit my needs. The slideshow should only begin after prompting it by pressing either the left or 
right navigation buttons. In the middle of the display, above the slideshow is the TUBES logo that created from 
scratch using both inkscape and then gimp. Both the svg and png files can be found in the main folder as well as 
a screenshot or two from the creation process. This logo can be compared to the logo on slide 3 which I created on gimp using 
a combination of the old bristol university logo and clip art images of a hammer and spanner. To see the actual logo, refer to 
'logo_awful.png' in the main folder, like most of the sources available to me when creating this site, the image is 
tiny and of low quality, hence why I made my own. The same also applied to the background image, it was originally a 
900px by 600px jpeg, I tried sharpening the image on gimp after enlarging it but this only made it worse. I found 
reducing the saturation and contrast whilst doing the opposite of what I originally intended, and instead of 
enhancing the image adding a gaussian blur made it look like the image was intentionally out of focus- or so I hope, 
it was the best I could do with the small collection of photos the team had access to.</p>
<p>Ideally the homescreen acts as the main hub to the web page without getting too messy and clogged up, 
right now it only links to two different pages on the site. I didn't see the point in adding huge amounts of 
news with the same format. I did want to add a third page with a calendar but it proved too difficult to do in 
the timespan, although I may still try to add this to the final site. In addition to that I also intend to 
add a search bar once the server side has been completed, which would simplify navigation through pages.</p>
<p>The navigation bar on top works fine for now without a search feature however due to having such few pages. In addition to the site 
being able to resize itself, the navigation bar also adapts with a drop down menu when the display shrinks. All 
the links should be valid, bar email and the fixture page being currently blank (where the calendar will go).</p>
<p>For the actual content of the website, I have gone with using a jumbotron (feature of bootstrap) to contain 
my news articles, this was in the hope that it would appear similar to a blog. The sizing and layout can easily be edited 
through the styles.css file with the addition of new content. The Team Page however is finalised bar the content of 
each players photos and details. Currently stock photos are acting as placeholders as I have no permission from 
members of the team bar mine. The team page uses containers and the display will either show 2 or 3 members 
per row depending on size of the display, though I have not tested on any mobile browsers I'm under the assumption 
2 per row should be discernable.</p>
